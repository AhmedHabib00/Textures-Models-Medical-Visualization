# Texture Mapping, Object Loading and Animation
Difficulties:
  loading objects with their right colours, but the application we are using is limited because it cant load jpg images.
  loading 2 conditions of the animation, 1 with the object and the other without, we made 2 display functions and making a switch condition binned to the menu in the right click
  to make sure when the object should be loaded and when it should not.
  another diffuculty was that we have drawn the water bottle at the end of the robotic arm so it can rotate when the arm is being rotated.
  we couldnt download any type of images (for example jpg) and then convert them to bmp, because they lose alot of information so we had to search for a suitable bmp image on the   internet.
